well, this is going to be strange.\
\
i used to journal a lot in my notes app on iphone, however i stopped after a while because typing on the phone was annoying.
also i ran out of things to worry about. it became a thing i turned to if i ever needed to sort out my thoughts on an issue.
though, looking back, it really was a helpful outlet for me, thus i am trying out this public type of blog instead (though i'm not sure who would even manage to find the link to this site...).\
\
anyhow, i'm looking forward to writing more!
